# Introduction

This is an summary of the hoof trimming and lesions data from `r start_month_1y` to `r end_month_1y`.
Historical data was used starting from 5 years back to determine the lesion history of cows trimmed in the last year.

Of note in this report you will at times see the data split out into the following categories:

-   *All Cases:*
    -   Includes all occurrences of a lesion.
    -   A cow could have had the lesion once or 5 times in the past year and all them are included.
    -   This category is important as it shows how many lame cows the go through the chute.
-   *First Cases:*
    -   Includes only cows that had a lesion for the first time in the past year.
    -   I consider this category the most important category as it tells us how many lame cows we are creating.
    -   The difference between *first cases* and *all cases* paints a picture of the number of chronic cows.
-   *Second Cases:*
    -   Includes only cows that had a lesion for the second time in the past year.
    -   This category includes cows that will eventually become chronic cows but also some cows that might just have needed a bit more time to heel.
    -   Three or more cases:
        -   Includes cows that had a lesion three or more times in the past year.
        -   These are the chronic cows and once we need to manage appropriately.

Additionally, tables and figures will be presented broken down by lactation group, months or across DIM categories.

# Timing of Trimming

@fig-trim_dist compares when cows get trimmed in each lactation and their lameness history between regions.

```{r}
#| label: fig-trim_dist

\newpage

# Time to Lesion After a Routine Trimming

@fig-time2lame shows how soon after a normal hoof trimming cows with no history of lesions have a hoof trimming with a lesion.

```{r}
#| label: fig-time2lame
#| fig-cap: "Cows start to have more lesions XX  days after their hoof trimming."

\newpage

@tbl-time_2_lame_current displays the % of cows with no history of lesions at trimming that become lame at specific time points after trimming.

# Lesion Comparison

The frequency of lesions types for 1st cases and all cases is shown in @fig-system_lesions.
The most common lesion is ........

## Lesions by Lactations

The frequency of lesions types for 1st cases and all cases by lactation is shown in @fig-lact_lesions. It is clear that the incidence of 1st cases goes down as lactation number increases but the number of repeat cases increases.

\newpage

## What is success rate of lesion?

@tbl-repeat shows the % of cows in the last year that had a lesion and repeated that lesions.
This is at the cow level not necessarily repeated on the same leg.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-repeat
#| tbl-cap: "Repeat % for 1st, 2nd and 3rd Cases."

# DIM Distribution of Infectious lesions across lactations

@fig-inf_dim shows when cows are getting infectious lesions in each lactation category.
The graphs shows the DIM distribution (% of total for each category) of 1st, 2nd life time lesions, and a total.
The ideal graph has no peaks meaning that cases are not just found at trimming.

\newpage

# DIM Distribution of Non-Infectious lesions across lactations

@fig-noninf_dim shows when cows are getting non-infectious lesions.
The graphs shows the DIM distribution (% of total) of 1st, 2nd life time lesions, and a total.

```{r}
#| label: fig-noninf_dim 
#| fig-height: 6.5

# Impact of Season for Infectious lesions

@fig-season_current Shows the seasonal pattern of infectious lesions.

# Time to next lesion after 1st Non-Infectious lesion

@fig-time2lame_after and @tbl-time_2_lame_after show that across lactation how much time it takes for cow to get any other lesion after her first non-infectious lesion.

```{r}
#| label: fig-time2lame_after
#| fig-cap: "Faster time to lameness after first lesion for older cows."

source("13_time_to_lame_after_lame_single.R")

\newpage

# Survival of cows after treatment for lesions

The following figures illustrate how quickly after a lesion diagnosis cows are culled (sold/died).
These figures are survival curves and have % of cows still alive on the *y axis* and time since the lesion on the *x axis.* These graphs have 4 different curves on them to show the difference between cows that have never had any lesion (healthy), and cows with one, two or three or more lifetime cases of the specific lesion.
Lines that are higher indicate cows that do not get culled as fast.
The shading around the line indicates the precision around the estimate of the line.
Typically if the shading overlaps we consider the lines similar with no evidence of a difference.

The tables following the graphs give the number of cows culled after 30, 120, and 180 days to give a sense of the numerical values behind the curves.

## Survival Curve of Cows with Non-infectious Lesions

From @fig-noninf_surv it is clear from that cows with lesions get culled faster than cows with no lesions at hoof trimming.

```{r}
#| label: fig-noninf_surv
#| fig-cap: "Cows with lesoins get culled faster and survival is worse for each repeated case."
#| fig-height: 5

```

\newpage

## Non-Infectious Culling Tables

@tbl-noninf_surv_farm1 gives the percentage of cows that left the herd 30, 120, and 180 days after lesion diagnosis across the different lifetime lesion categories.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-noninf_surv_farm1
#| tbl-cap: "Cows with lesions have a higher culling probability and this increases with each repeated case"

tbl_surv_farm1
```

\newpage

## Survival Curves of Cows with DD

From @fig-dd_surv it is clear that cows with DD leave faster then cows with no lesion at hoof trimming.

```{r}
#| label: fig-dd_surv
#| fig-cap: "Cows with DD get culled faster than healthy cows and it increases with each case."
#| fig-height: 5

source("16_dd_survival_multiple_farms.R")

\newpage

## DD Culling Tables

@tbl-dd_surv_farm1 gives the percentage of cows that left the herd 30, 120, and 180 days after lesion diagnosis across the different lifetime lesion categories.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-dd_surv_farm1
#| tbl-cap: "Cows with DD have a similar culling probability compared to healthy cows."

## Which Legs do lesion occur on?

@tbl-leg summarizes which leg lesions occur on on each site. This table is at the bottom as I don't always use it but for this herd it is weird that RH is so much different than LH
